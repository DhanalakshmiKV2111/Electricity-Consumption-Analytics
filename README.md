# Electricity Consumption Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes household electricity consumption using a custom dataset and Power BI dashboards. It focuses on consumption patterns, cost analysis, peak-hour usage, and appliance-wise energy distribution.

## Dataset
- Custom-generated CSV with 500 rows
- Columns: House_ID, City, Month, Appliance, Units_Consumed, Cost_INR, Peak_Hour

## Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop
- Microsoft Excel

## Dashboard Features
1. Monthly Electricity Consumption (Line Chart)
2. Total Electricity Cost by City (Bar Chart)
3. Electricity Consumption by Appliance (Donut Chart)
4. Peak vs Non-Peak Electricity Cost by Appliance (Stacked Bar Chart)
5. Total Units Consumed and Total Cost (Cards)
6. Interactive Slicers for City, Month, and Appliance

## Key Insights
- Identifies peak consumption hours
- Highlights costliest appliances
- Shows monthly and city-wise consumption patterns
- Enables data-driven cost optimization

## Future Scope
- Extend dataset with real smart meter data
- Add predictive models for energy usage forecasting
- Integrate alerts for high consumption
